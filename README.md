### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am franco dimiceli and I am currently enrolled in Nottingham College doing an extended diploma IT course. I like programming because it lets me solve problems and let me be creative with my solutions. In my spare time, I like to do some gaming and I research computer components. In the future, I would like to create and complete more programming projects, improve my programming skills, improve my other skills and get new ones, educate myself further and eventually get to do a job that I enjoy.

Skills:

- Basic Python programming 
- website development
- project management
- time management
- problem solveing
- critical thinking
